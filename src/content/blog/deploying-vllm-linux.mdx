# 🚀 Deploying vLLM on Your Linux Server

Running **vLLM** as a persistent, reliable background service is one of the best ways to expose a fast local LLM API on your Linux machine.  
This guide walks through:

- Installing dependencies
- Creating a virtual environment
- Setting up a **systemd** service
- Running vLLM from a fixed directory (`/home/nurbot/ws/models`)
- Checking logs and debugging
- Enabling auto-start on boot

---

# 🧰 1. Install System Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip python3-venv docker.io
```

Docker is optional but useful if you want containerized workflows.

---

# 🎮 2. Verify NVIDIA GPU Support (Optional but Recommended)

Check whether the machine has working NVIDIA drivers:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

If the command is missing, install drivers before running GPU-backed vLLM.

---

# 🐍 3. Create the vLLM Virtual Environment

We place it in `/opt/vllm-env`:

```bash
sudo python3 -m venv /opt/vllm-env
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/vllm-env
source /opt/vllm-env/bin/activate
```

Install vLLM + OpenAI API compatibility:

```bash
pip install vllm openai
```

---

# 📁 4. Configure where vLLM Runs From

We want vLLM to run from:

```
/home/nurbot/ws/models
```

This directory will contain the `start_vllm.sh` script.

Ensure the start script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x /home/nurbot/ws/models/infrastructure/scripts/start_vllm.sh
```

---

# 🧩 5. Create the Systemd Service

Create the service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/vllm.service
```

Paste:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=vLLM Inference Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=nurbot
WorkingDirectory=/home/nurbot/ws/models
ExecStart=/home/nurbot/ws/models/infrastructure/scripts/start_vllm.sh
Restart=always
Environment=MODEL_NAME=facebook/opt-125m

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then reload systemd:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

---

# ▶️ 6. Starting, Stopping, and Enabling the Service

Start vLLM:

```bash
sudo systemctl start vllm
```

Check its status:

```bash
systemctl status vllm
```

Enable auto-start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable vllm
```

---

# 📡 7. Checking Logs

To see the real-time logs from vLLM:

```bash
journalctl -u vllm -f
```

To see historical logs:

```bash
journalctl -u vllm
```

To see recent errors:

```bash
journalctl -u vllm -xe
```

---

# 🛠 8. Troubleshooting

### **Service says “failed”**

Run:

```bash
systemctl status vllm
journalctl -u vllm -xe
```

Common issues:

- Wrong `ExecStart` path
- Missing execute permission
- Python crash inside vLLM
- GPU not available / out of memory

---

# 🎯 Conclusion

You now have a fully functional **vLLM OpenAI-compatible server** running as a background service on Linux. It's stable, auto-starts on reboot, logs to systemd, and uses a clean virtual environment with GPU acceleration.
